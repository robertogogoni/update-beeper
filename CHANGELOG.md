# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Natural Language Commands** - Multiple ways to trigger updates conversationally
  - Shell aliases: `bu`, `bv`, `beeper update`, `beeper version`
  - Jarvis wrapper: `jarvis-beeper "update beeper"`, `jarvis-beeper "is beeper up to date"`
  - Claude Code skill integration: Say "Update Beeper" or "I need to update Beeper"

- **`--versions` flag** - Show all version info at a glance
  - Displays installed, latest, and AUR versions in a clean table
  - Shows update status and AUR lag indicator

- **Health Monitoring** - Auto-recovery for the dreaded "blank screen" bug
  - New `beeper-health` script detects unresponsive Beeper
  - Checks if process is running but window is missing (blank screen symptom)
  - Auto-restarts with XWayland mode if blank screen detected
  - Systemd timer for 5-minute monitoring interval

### Fixed

- **Critical: Version detection bug** - Now uses `package.json` as source of truth
  - Previously used `pacman -Q` which returns AUR version, not actual installed version
  - This caused incorrect "up to date" reports when AUR was behind but direct install was current

- **Arithmetic expansion crash** in `beeper-version` when versions are "unknown"
  - Added validation guards before version comparisons
  - Gracefully handles network failures and missing data

- **AUR version extraction** - Fixed non-POSIX regex (`\d` → `[0-9]`)

- **Curl timeout** - Added 10-second timeout to prevent hanging on network issues

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Lockfile-based concurrency protection** using `flock`
  - Prevents multiple update-beeper instances from running simultaneously
  - Shows PID of blocking process if lock already held
  - Automatically released on exit (including crashes)

- **New CLI options**
  - `--quiet` / `-q`: Silent mode for cron/systemd (only outputs on errors)
  - `--rollback` / `-r`: Manual rollback to previous backup version
  - `--version` / `-v`: Show script version

- **Wayland native rendering support** for Hyprland, Sway, and other Wayland compositors
  - Automatically detects Wayland via `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
  - Tests Beeper startup with Ozone platform flags (`--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`)
  - Creates desktop file override at `~/.local/share/applications/beeper.desktop`
  - Fixes blank/white window issues on Wayland without XWayland

- **Sleep/wake stability fix** via `--disable-gpu-compositing` flag
  - Prevents blank screen after screensaver, screen lock, or system sleep
  - Included in Wayland flags by default

- **System compatibility checks** run automatically before updates
  - Architecture verification (x86_64 required)
  - Distro detection (warns if not Arch-based, still works)
  - Dependency check (curl, sudo required)
  - Optional dependency warning (notify-send)

### Changed

- Replaced process-grepping concurrent run detection with proper lockfile mechanism
- Version output now uses `log()` helper for quiet mode support

### Fixed

- **Directory leak in `backup_current()`** - Now uses subshell to prevent working directory changes from affecting the main script
- **Directory leak in extraction loop** - Extraction now runs in isolated subshell
- **UX: "Configuring Wayland" message** - Only displays when actually on Wayland
- Removed hardcoded username/UID from systemd service file
- Scripts now work for any user without modification

### Why This Exists

Beeper's built-in updater doesn't work on Arch Linux when installed from AUR.
The app downloads updates but can't overwrite pacman-managed files. This script
downloads directly from Beeper's API, bypassing both the broken built-in updater
and the often-outdated AUR package.
